# Project Name

The project this week, and the first project in sprint 2, our task was to produce a Pizzeria bot. That is a make up-order

## The problem

I looked at Damiens video and used his example with the "alarm clock" as a basis. I had problems getting each step to work when I first tried using const instead of let and to move on to the next prompt or alert when making an incorrect input, such as choosing nr 4 instead of 1, 2, 3 which are the available options. Then I googled and asked chat gpt and got the response to use while loops. I tried that with some google help and Matildas instructions on the Thursday session and it worked out well. 

I have used let as variable and while loops to check if the user's input is not one of the valid options by using === strict equality operator.  

If  √ç hade more time I would try to add more prompts and alerts such as more meal options and add a background image or hero, order button and dig deeper into the JS basics and how to write less code but achieve the same.
